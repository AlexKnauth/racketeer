Issues
-------
 - white/unevaluated tests if there is some syntax error in a definition
 - can't handle strings
 - noticable lag
 - Loading some saved file doesn't work - highlighting turns off right away
 - Partial highlighting of tests, and overflow of highlights; anything out of test-length range of the cursor doesn't get properly highlighted, if at all
