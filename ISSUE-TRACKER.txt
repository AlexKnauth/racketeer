Issues
-------

- Editing in the middle of a test case will sometimes cause DrRacket to crash:
    - when the edit removes one of a matching ""
    - when #f or #t remove either the char or the #
 - Loading some saved file doesn't work
 - Partial highlighting of tests, and overflow of highlights; anything out of test-length range of the cursor doesn't get properly highlighted, if at all
