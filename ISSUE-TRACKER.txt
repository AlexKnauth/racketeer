An incredibly cutting-edge issue tracker until we move to a VC system with an actual issue tracker.

Issues
========

Unresolved
-----------
- Find (reproduce?) any elusive sequence-contract-violation errors.
- Clear statusbar on switching windows/tabs.

Fixed/closed
--------------
- Handle large files
- Get languages from GUI selection
- Handle WXME files
- White/unevaluated tests if there is some syntax error in a definition
- Can't handle strings
- Noticable lag
- Loading some saved file doesn't work - highlighting turns off right away
- Partial highlighting of tests, and overflow of highlights; anything out of test-length range of the cursor doesn't get properly highlighted, if at all
